        <div class="left helnu">Adam has been with IBM for four years. He has actively sought professional challenges and striven in all his roles to drive design stewardship through leading by example and bringing people together around shared interest areas. He is known within IBM Systems and IBM Design as an active design leader who engages with offering management, design, engineering, sales & marketing and support to understand IBM Design Thinking, how it interlocks with Agile and Offering Management and how these frameworks benefit teams, markets and outcomes for Power, zSystems and Storage. His elevation to Design Principal would be a natural career advancement and in keeping with what he already does. <br><br>

            <span class="helnuital">âAs you may know from working with IBMers, we tend to put in a lot of function into our systems but not think too much about how it can overwhelm the users - especially novices. Adam is driving us to avoid âcognitive overloadâ for our users and yet make sure we donât lose the functionality. And given the pressure to deliver, I really appreciate Adamâs standing up and fighting for the design and taking the time to test alternatives on real end users. This attention will not only help prevent the need for a 'do-over' during implementation but will help us make the right first impression in the marketplaceâ</span><br><br>

            Adam joined the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/storage/spectrum/" target="_blank">Tivoli Storage</a> design group in late 2011 as a Senior Information Architect. He was an individual contributor working on Tivoli Operations Center, a new storage administration solution designed with modern front end programming languages and using OneUI language (pre IBM Design Language). <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/" target="_blank">IBM Design Thinking</a> was being newly rolled out and he attended one of the early design camps (now called Designweek). <br><br>
<span class="secPara">After three months he was recognized for leadership skills that demonstrated both mentoring and design culture. He became a UX Team Lead in early 2013. His understanding of how to integrate design from an operational and practice standpoint in large corporations enabled him to organize and put practices in place to keep the growing Storage UX team aligned and focused. Adam also met with customers through user groups and workshops to understand their perspective as well as working environments in order to affect both strategy, vision and execution. He also became a client advocate for Getty Images.<br><br>
He became involved with the early development of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/us/en-us?cm_mc_uid=07514333821614399974013&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1477844139" target="_blank">Service Engage</a> on <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/" target="_blank">DeveloperWorks</a> where SaaS solutions would be offered for sale and he worked cross discipline to define a user experience model to connect IBM.com to DeveloperWorks. Leading the effort to secure the Storage area to enter the Hallmark program he led a team that focused on simplifying the way clients access storage server environments through File Restore, a self-serve web-based portal for line-of-business users to easily recover lost or corrupt files without the intervention of a system administrator released in 2014 to the market.<br><br>
Adam joined <a href="http://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/us-en/" target="_blank">IBM Systems</a> Strategy & Transformation team in 2014 to bring his design eminence as IBM Systems Design Lead to interface with Power, zSystems and Storage Design Champions, evangelize the use of IBM Design Thinking practices with product teams and help with active Hallmark Projects by coaching and mentoring offering teams over time to increase their confidence and competence in IBM Design Thinking. <br><br>
Working with management, Adam collaborated in defining and building a design capability within the IBM Systems Strategy & Development organization in late 2015. This team was provided the opportunity to work on the re-envisioning of SmartCare, a business intelligence tool to help IBMers manage client accounts and monitor support pain. Adam led the definition of the project, design research, facilitated a key workshop with IBMers and sponsor users, defined a UX model.  <br><br>
Due to our work for SmartCare, the Strategy & Development Design Team became involved with the important IBM Client Support Transformation initiative through Robert McDonald. Starting with envisioning and prototyping a self-help support capability called Guided Support within IBM Support Portal Beta, it leverages IBM Care, Watson Alchemy (natural language processing) and Asset Reuse Manager through short query conversation. Adam is now leading design efforts in taking IBM Design incubator Project Opel recommendations and driving its implementation.
    Adam has engaged with end-customers and IBM Partners in venues such as Tivoli User Groups and IBM conferences. He has also led many workshops around IBM Design Thinking and Agile for IBM product teams, with sponsor user participation.</span><br><br>

                Having been part of several large organizations before joining IBM three years ago, when I would ask these organizations about their customers and if they were focused on their needs. All said unequivocally âyesâ but then follow this answer with the way their part of the organization had their needs and plans for markets - usually not clearly connected to the âyesâ statement.<br><br>

            âOur doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt.â<br>
            William Shakespeare, Measure for Measure<br><br>
            
            <img src="images/IBM/Projects/Posters/Risk.jpg" /><br><br>
            
            As IBM transforms into a cognitive company supported by IBM Design Thinking with Agile culture, the intersection of belief and demonstrable value looms over everything we create. Our motto may be âThink,â but it is more than just a word silkscreened on our shirts. Coined by Thomas Watson in 1911, his intent was for us to âThinkâ by widening our thoughts and focusing our minds to transform old ways of doing business into new by bringing fresh positivity and ground-breaking solutions to the world and markets we serve. To truly widen and focus our perspectives and enhance our products and services, we must accept both the power and pain of transformation, as well as the inherent element of risk that it brings.<br><br>
            For simple problems where incremental change occurs, the future seems easy to understand. Yet, for more complex problems with many interdependencies and unknowns, the act of designing can easily fall apart. When designing the ânewâ, there is little precedent and many evolving opportunities, unknowns, and constraints. John Chris Jones, the British industrial designer who wrote the book Design Methods in 1970 saw the challenge of design:<br><br>
            âThe act of designing is difficult because designers are given problems to solve by using current information to predict a future state that will not come about unless their predictions are correct.â<br><br>
            As designers, we aim to radically collaborate with users and specific disciplines to observe and ask the right questions about ourselves, our solutions and our markets (âwidening our thoughtsâ). We reflect and identify hurdles that impede value and deter innovation (âfocusing our mindsâ). We prototype in order to learn, become wiser and more confident through iteration and focus in order to create transformative, iconic outcomes (âtransform old ways of doing businessâ). To create truly relevant solutions, it is critical we approach this process with as little prejudice or personal agenda as possible. We also need to be mindful of how transformations can expose us, and our clients, to risk and how to capitalize on or mitigate risk as needed.<br><br>
            Simply put, risk is some level of probability of negative exposure which may negate the level of utility we want to achieve. Some negative probabilities have a high chance of happening and some have a low to nonexistent chance. Translated into finance, stocks are riskier than bonds, but generate higher returns over long periods. Response to risk is not universal. People generally tend to be naturally risk adverse since we donât like to sacrifice what we think we currently have for the possibility of something better, even for possible eventual gain. So people will either respond to risk through fear and retreat, while others will respond with curiosity and acceptance. But both will try to understand and mitigate negative exposure to risk.<br><br>
            Common types of risks :
            <ul class="bulleted">
                <li>bias and stereotypes (people to people or individuals/team to assumptions)</li>
                <li>people to values (lack of values or shared mental models and culture)</li>
                <li>people to people (distrust or power plays)</li>
                <li>people to skills (lack of skills)</li>
                <li>people to time (lack of urgency or the ability to act in time)</li>
                <li>where the new meets established processes, procedures and protocols (âwe donât do it that wayâ)</li>
                <li>missing market cycles (too early or late)</li>
            </ul>
            
            Despite striking fear into our hearts by its association with failure, shortcoming and potential humiliation, risk is not inherently negative. Over my career as a visual designer, identity systems designer, brand strategist, information architect and UX Lead and UX Manager, risk has always been with me. At first risk made me fearful as I did not know how to respond to it â sort of like a bad horror film where you see shadow and no form. It seemed out of my control to do anything about it (and usually it was). <br><br>
            As I became more seasoned and began to collaborate with other roles that impacted my work, risk became something to manage. By talking about risk and what it means, it helped determine the level of actual exposure to a work item, a deadline â or even the goal of a project. As I began to lead teams and work on problems where there was little precedent, risk became an old friend, not to fear but to embrace and deal with. In Mandarin the symbol for crisis is a combination of danger (crisis/risk) and opportunity. Opportunity is associated with a potentially risky exploration in which all an individual or company has is a hypothesis and bits of experience projected onto a desired outcome. We need to ask ourselves about these variables:<br>
            <ul class="bulleted">
                <li>why is this goal important to me/us?</li>
                <li>what do we know?</li>
                <li>what would we like to find out?</li>
            </ul>
            Agile culture realizes the positive element of risk and exhorts the creed to âfail early and fastâ where we iteratively learn to understand what doesnât work, isolating and iterating possible solutions until a team achieves the desired result.  IBMâs growth businesses were born in this millennium and a culture of uncertainty, ambiguity and risk has been built in. However, in our decades-old core businesses this transformation is proving far more elusive. To innovate and create meaningful change interrupts the status quo, which is often well-entrenched after years of stability. Shaking things up can be unnerving, but it is necessary for transformation change.<br><br>
            Because design is associated with exploring without constraint, a fourth variable may also arise: discovering things we did not know we didnât know. There is a psychology and sociology around exploration. Ideally, designers seek to understand stakeholdersâ articulated needs and examine them against what their actual environments and behaviors tells us. The goal is to predict and balance their immediate needs and desires with those of their foreseeable future. âPredictâ is the operative word. It can expose a designer or design team to levels of negative risk. Whether viewed as a transformative opportunity or a disaster depends largely on the environment in which designers work. If the culture is open to embracing ambiguity and unknown factors, realizing the value of a new variable is great. If the environment is punitive and risk-adverse, designers will be less likely to act on these opportunities and the potential reward will be lost.<br><br>
            There are pitfalls lurking for an explorer/designer. One is âmagical thinking.â This involves creating causal relationships between actions and events not justified by reason and observation, but by personal bias or preconceived ideas. Bordering on fallacy, these relationships are often imagined to will a theory into reality through brute force. Based on bias and poor observations, they often result in the worst possible outcome â negative results and experiences for our clients. There are also risks difficult to anticipate which can derail even the best-planned journey. This is why we include users as active collaborators to make sure that our emerging model of the future is co-created. In the 100th Anniversary book âMaking the World Work Betterâ Thomas Watson Jr. tried out the concept of âcollaboratoriesâ where IBM Research was paired up with IBM Sales to accelerate new products:<br><br>
            " . . . customers would no longer be satisfied with the choice of either accepting a company's offering or walking away; they wanted to help companies craft their products and services . . . in so called FIrst-of-a-Kind projects that bring inventions more quickly to market." pp-188-189<br><br>
            How can you and your team recognize, address or take advantage of risk? Over the course of a project, there are many risks opportunities around timelines, resources, milestones and informed assumptions based on direct experience or research provided by offering managers and Design Research. The goal of Design Research as Adam Cutler stated is âformalized curiosity with a purpose.â Research can validate assumptions, increase clarity, uncover new opportunities and lend fresh insights to the goal. Other common risks include the complexity of IBM solutions, the ramp-up period for the team to understand the current state of a solution,  research data overwhelming a team, and certain assumptions about markets, users and behaviors not being properly validated.<br><br>
            IBM Design Thinking and Agile have specific practices that help designers overcome negative risk exposure. A key practice is to create a social contract within a team so that everyone defines trust, respect, openness, courage and empathy. This helps the team identify and discuss risk in a safe and supportive environment. Keep all work visible to the entire team and make sure they are informed of individual and team outputs. Use an assumptions matrix where they can rate project assumptions as either âcertainâ or âuncertainâ as well as rating them as either âhighâ or âlowâ risk for more evidence-based, confidence-weighted decisions to determine how additional research can validate uncertain and high risk assumptions.<br><br>
            Phil Gilbert has said that as we explore using IBM Design Thinking we should not to worry if an activity or outcome is âthrow awayâ or not. The focus should be on gaining greater and greater clarity over time to differentiate what is known and unknown and to know the difference between the two. During the design journey, it is important to remain optimistic about what can be done with the team and time allocated for the project. <br><br>
            Risk can be ameliorated by harnessing you and your teams "Think" towards a risk in relation to a goal. So, embrace risk's duality of negative energy and positive outcomes, actively exploring through the team-based approach using IBM Design Thinking practices through critical thinking skills to become more industrious, and achieve a higher degree of mindfulness to increase understanding of a problem. By staying curious and braving the waves of uncertainty, your team will be more open to recognizing new possibilities â and the rewards that opportunity affords you.<br><br>
            "Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go."<br>

            Adam delivers many presentations to different stakeholders on a wide variety of subjects. He continually aggregates content from IBM Design, W3 and other sources to amplify initiatives. A good example of this effort is the harmonization of Offering Management, IBM Design Thinking and Agile. Many teams do not understand the role of Offering Managers and many are not Agile. Adam created a presentation called â<a href="images/IBM/Projects/PDF/IconicOutcomes5.pdf" target="_blank">Iconic Outcomes</a>â that connects the external and corporate forces that are driving the integration and takes a team through the Offering Management wheel and how IBM Design Thinking and Agile work together to create better outcomes.

        IBM Design Thinking was just being introduced in 2012 when Adam joined IBM. He reached out to IBM Design leaders to learn more about it and has collaborated with IBM Design over three years on a wide variety of topics and initiatives. He has worked with Pierre Henri Clouin and Daniel Kuehn in making improvements to the Hallmark Program based on his direct experiences in onboarding and coaching several IBM Systems Hallmark teams. Adam interacts with 14 IBM Systems Hallmark teams, meeting with many of them twice a month to review progress and coach the 3-in-a-box leadership on the craft of design and how to address blockers. He also prepared several teams to present to Adam Cutler and his design team on reviewing Hallmark progress through high frame rate reels.<br><br>

        He also has been involved with the IBM Design Incubator Program to coordinate IBM Systems incubators, as well as a design subject matter expert for Project Thor, focusing on the future of support at IBM. This had led to discussions of aligning the Incubator mini and max programs to scale down to two day bootcamps for experienced hires as well as spin off Incubator max to IBM Systems zSystems to germinate a business unit incubator program with both Tim White and Brad Neal.<br><br>
        In his current role he has led the monthly IBM Systems Design Council, a cross section of design managers, offering managers and designers that has addressed a variety of topics such as design research, offering management, and specific hallmark team presentations.<br><br>
        Adam was invited to be part of the Magic People cohort of experienced facilitators led by Jordan Shade due to his eminence in running workshops at IBM. He was also invited to present to IBM Design Bootcamp for College Hires and presented how infrastructure affects UX and also co-lead an IBM Design Bootcamp for Experienced Hires with Tim White.<br><br>

One major outcome of this session was the creation of the mentor program for new designers in IBM Systems. Adam continued his leadership role leading the myself and other design leaders through the creation of the program. We launched the program matching new designers with design leads. A few months later, he led the effort to collect feedback from the community to determine the success and failures of the program. Learning of the issues, he rebooted the program and we saw a huge spike in engagement. This program was so successful, in part due to Adamâs leadership, IBM Design adopted the program and rolled it out for all new designers in IBM.â</span><br><br>
